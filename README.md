## Introduction
Hi, I'm Victor. I'm a  4th Year Computer Science and Enginnering Student from University of California, Merced. This github has a lot of my side projects, classwork and project that I or
a small team have worked on. I like working on solving interview questions on my off time and I like working with arduino to create small projects in real life.
